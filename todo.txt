- new icons for "curses to ___" spells
- renamed "master of thunder" to "master of lightning"
- bugfix: cursed chests now spawn the correct amount of random spells





patch 1.2

[ ] figure out how to properly remove perks. curse lifter might be an important perk to implement.
[ ] lock "master of" perks behind killing the Master of Masters with the corresponding weakening curse?
  [ ] create "weakening curse - fire"
[-] LOL giga drain bubbles pass through the player if they have the "phasing" perk. should this change...? <-- nah



ALT FIRE ANYTHING

A spell inspired by the various Alt Fire spells of [b]Apotheosis[/b].
This mod 

Current Limitations / Known Bugs
- Your wand loses mana for all spells slotted behind Alt Fire Anything, not just the ones that were cast
- Recharge time is fixed to just your wand's recharge time. Ideally, the fired spells' cast delay and recharge time should be added.
- Invisibility is not interrupted when alt-firing

[-] check out "directors_helpers.lua" for entity_load_chest --> better place for cursed chest logic? <-- can't find a hook here

nucleus move speed:
[ ] make nucleus use the projectile's own speed, but let it naturally not decelerate
[ ] consider making the nucleus' move speed lower if it's far away from the player

nucleus mechanics:
[ ] maybe make the whole spell mana-blue?! or even electric??!!?!?! (look at thunder charge (thunderball.xml))
[ ] don't use get_player() to store variables, use e.g. "owner" instead (so that for example enemies can also use it)
[ ] also scale physics_power stuff, so that creatures that do get hit get blown away real good

nucleus vfx:
[ ] add gradually increasing screenshake while charging
[ ] right before exploding, make ALL particles zap towards the projectile's absolute centerpoint (0,0); explode ~20 frames later
[ ] Nathan's idea for explosion particles with less drag / more spin?
[ ] Graham's idea for an extra bright flash of light on detonation?
[ ] Copi's idea for a hit stun?
[ ] Mamumimi's idea for looking into orb_expanding to make the sprite bigger over time?

nucleus sfx:
[ ] look for a better firing sound maybe (not the firebolt one)
[ ] maybe another looping sound on top of the black hole one? to make it layered/more unique
[ ] add lava rumbling sound at some point, also ukko electric crackling maybe (can we edit "m_volume" in AudioLoopComponent?)
[ ] concentrated mana sound that increases in volume 0-100 as charges increase from 0-1000?
[ ] change/add to explosion sound based on charge amount

nucleus testing/promo:
[ ] current interaction with speed modifiers?
[ ] interaction with larpa?
[ ] quote the threaded post in #mod-showcase to broadcast its addition to the d2d pack



=== 16.09.2025 ===

[ ] mirror spell: "Polymorphs you into whatever creature it hits" (max. 10 uses)

[ ] ice barrage mage: encases you in a block of ice when its projectile hits you

[ ] "master of" perks: deal 10k+ damage with the corresponding element to unlock the perk?

[ ] flamethrower: an actual continuous stream of small fire "projectiles" that penetrates enemies and does a tiny amount of (ACTUAL)
    fire dmg per frame. to make it an actual stream, cast delay and reload time should be super low (like lumi drill: -0.58 / -0.17?)
    [ ] could be cool but could also be feature creep: make each projectile fired increase the intensity of the flamethrower,
        until mouse is released



=== 19.09.2025 ===

[-] perk that makes gold nuggets glow in the dark <-- tooo niche
[x] friend of the fairies perk should not heal the player if it reduces incoming damage below 0; summon fairies should not spawn from 
    it; limit damage reduction to 50% of original damage?
[x] flurry might be too strong, if you have a wand with high mana charge speed, there's no reason to use reduce recharge time anymore
[ ] check "slow projectiles" spell code for double damage?
[ ] spell that can only have 1 in existence, but its cast delay is extremely low (so it becomes super strong close-range)
[ ] summon fairies: add giant fairy death particles on small fairies spawn?


=== 24.09.2025 ===

[ ] make giga drain bubbles ignore shields (if possible), since touching them with a shield makes them un-pickupable
[ ] giga drain damage could be finetuned to make it possible to deal minimal damage to a drained enemy
[ ] giga drain recoil could be halved maybe
[ ] enemies that do not drop gold (i.e. hive spawns) should not drop bubbles?
[ ] giga drain: track total max hp gained by giga drain, GamePrint every 50th
[ ] master of fire: bring 2 or 3 kivaskivi somewhere?
[ ] make overclock always explode at the wand's position (instead of on a payload)
[ ] set giga drain's speed to 0, but spawn it at the wand's launch point if not on a payload?
