ALT FIRE ANYTHING

A spell inspired by the various Alt Fire spells of [b]Apotheosis[/b].
This mod 

Current Limitations / Known Bugs
- Your wand loses mana for all spells slotted behind Alt Fire Anything, not just the ones that were cast
- Recharge time is fixed to just your wand's recharge time. Ideally, the fired spells' cast delay and recharge time should be added.
- Invisibility is not interrupted when alt-firing

[-] check out "directors_helpers.lua" for entity_load_chest --> better place for cursed chest logic? <-- can't find a hook here
