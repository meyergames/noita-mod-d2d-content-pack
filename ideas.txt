IDEAS

[ ] Parry: short-range, medium-cooldown "explosion" that, when timed well, deflects bullets (like Revenge Bullets) with extra speed and damage.

[ ] Give the player "Peace With Gods" if they win a race while the gods were angry? (and the player was infected as a result)

[x] Borrowed Time: perk that splits half of all damage taken into damage-over-time (i.e. normally taking 44 damage from an explosion will now deal 22 damage instantaneously + 11 + 6 + 3 + 2 damage spread over 4 cycles of 1 second each)

[ ] Rework cursed chest into something like an "Unholy Contract"? With unique powerful perks (Master Of?) and spells (i.e. Curses To Damage) in trade for a perk. Could effectively still be a "chest" but with a different aesthetic.
- "Curses" need an icon for spells etc, and maybe for the lock on a cursed chest.

[ ] Divine prank: encase the player in a circle of brickwork(?) until their O2 is almost ran out

[ ] Pocket Dimension: Utility spell that stores all spells behind it as children of this spell. If it already contains spells, the spells are re-spawned for the player to pick up.

[ ] "Alt Fire Anything" base spell
Regular left-click: skip this spell and the (first) card it draws. If that seems technically impossible, reset the wand and trigger wand recharge time.
Right-click:		scan the wand for the first occurrence of this "Alt Fire" spell, and draw the first card behind it.

[x] modifier that has a chance to save a limited-use spell's uses is now possible!

[x] Fairy Reincarnation: enemies turn into small fairies upon death, lighting up the area

[-] One Wand Army: increase your damage dealt based on how few wands you are carrying <-- takes away the motivation to experiment

[ ] Maybe the "Rewind" spell is possible now, with my new understanding of the code?

[ ] Behind You! curse: a bomb floats behind you. when shot (by an enemy), it explodes for minor damage and knockback. recharges and reappears after 30 seconds

[ ] Divine prank: severely limit the player's FOV (like that one wizard) and play the sound of a really scary monster

[ ] Beacon: an item whose location is permanently shown on the player's UI, like on an Item Radar

[x] Reveal: a limited-use spell that temporarily reveals nearby wands and items

[ ] To "disable" a perk (e.g. for Master Of X), maybe we can get the perk's UIComponent and simply change its description and icon, and run the necessary scripts (i.e. the perk function "_remove" or smth)

[ ] Curse: like spontaneous combustion, but for a 5-second blindness effect "A mosquito flew into your eye!" (maybe with a permanent light added buzzing sound effect? like the firefly - maybe it could just spawn an entity that's like the Apotheosis swarm, but with less particles and only sporadically dealing 1 flavour damage) perk name: "Mosquitoes"

[-] do add Alt Fire Anything to this mod, as well?

[ ] Backtrack: "Teleports you to where you last touched the ground" (overwrite previous location when mFramesInAirCounter is exactly 1?)

[ ] Dismantle Wand: spell that destroys a nearby wand and spawns all the spells it contains.

[ ] ANVIL SPELLS: destroyed-on-use spells that alter your wand in one way or another.
	[ ] Hammer of Order | Makes a wand non-shuffle, sets its spells/cast to 1, and removes its always-cast spells
	[ ] Hammer of Chaos | Consume all spells to increase all stats, but the wand (has a chance to?) becomes shuffle
	[ ] Hammer of Capacity | Consume all spells to add +1 capacity for every 2 spells sacrificed (max 25)
	[ ] Hammer of Potential | Consume all spells to increase max mana by +25 for each spell sacrificed
	[ ] Hammer of Velocity | Consume all spells to increase fire rate by +10% for each spell sacrificed
	[ ] random spell spawns on the anvil in Hiisi Base, the rest is super rare
	[ ] when cast, the spell spawns the wand outside as a non-interactable

[ ] Simple perk that sets all wands' spells per cast to 1 ("No More Multicast")

[ ] Alcoholism curse: your aim is disturbed if you are NOT drunk. alcohol does not satiate you. (spawns a bottle of whiskey)

[ ] Unlock "Master Of X" by dealing Y damage of the same type during your run. if threshold passed, spawn perk on next enemy kill
	[ ] Try an electricity-oriented run (i.e. Electric Charge) and count the damage (via GamePrint obv)
	[ ] same for fire
	[ ] same for explosions

[ ] I should be able to make the Time Trial effect a timed status effect now, right?

[ ] Perk "Lost The Key": in the next biome, 1 (or more?) key is spawned somewhere that must be collected before the portals to the next Holy Mountain open. Some kind of reward upon entering the Holy Mountain.
	[ ] Might work better as a curse? "Lost My Keys!"

[ ] Minigun-esque passive spell that increases your wand's fire rate the longer the fire button is held. Could also gradually decrease a spell's mana cost by a bit, though maybe that'd be a bit unbalanced; it should have *some* kind of limit. (although maybe firing 60 magic arrows per second comes with its own set of downsides already)

[ ] Ness "PK Flash" spell that fires a slow, pulsating projectile ("bomb") if the player has none in the field already. While the player keeps the fire button down, the active wand's mana recharge is disabled; every second, 10% of the wand's max mana is consumed to fuel the bomb, sending homing particles from the wand to the bomb, its size and damage increasing based on mana consumed. Releasing the fire button, or when mana runs out after 10 seconds, causes the bomb to explode.
> max mana determines max charges (i.e. size/damage/effects)		example: 	1400 max mana = 1400 max charges
> mana charge speed determines charges per seconds					example: 	0 mana ch.sp  = +140 charges per second
  (minimum of +10% charge per second)								example:	10 mana ch.sp = +150 charges per second
																				255 m.ch.sp   = +395 charges per second
  (amount of particles sent from wand to bomb scales with charges added)
- 200+ charges: bomb starts attracting nearby liquids and powders like a black hole
- 400+ charges: bomb starts attracting nearby objects like barrels and lanterns
- 600+ charges: bomb starts attracting nearby enemies
- 800+ charges: bomb will release an earthquake upon exploding
- damage scaling should be somewhat exponential, to give a player a good reason to chase max mana > mana charge speed

[ ] A simple spell that grows bigger and more powerful the more mana the wand is missing, and the longer it takes for the wand to recharge its mana. A simplified missing mana to damage, basically. Maybe instead of increasing damage based on mana charge speed, the spell (and its low mana cost) naturally asks for a slow-charging wand in order to even reach the high damage boost.

[ ] essence to speed (increase fire rate if lots of enemies are nearby)

[x] spell that lasts ~5 frames and converts all nearby enemy projectiles (mWhoShot ~= player) into healing. high cast delay/recharge time.

[-] Inverse Energy Shield: looks in the opposite direction of the player's aim

[ ] Autonomous Energy Shield: rotates independently of aim direction, always looking at the nearest enemy that can be hit with a raycast

[x] Beacon (spell): creates a hovering beacon (similar to an aqua mine) that is always on the player's radar (until destroyed). It can be interacted with, using E, to change its color in the world and on the radar. Radar shape is unique to easily tell it apart from the radar perks.
	[-] While holding shift, show distance below radar marker? <-- faint/medium/strong does the job

[ ] Beacon teleport (spell): warp to the nearest placed beacon (that a raycast can't reach?). Very limited-use. Eligible beacon is highlighted on the radar.

[ ] Luminous Orb?

[ ] heart balloon, alt. time trial

[ ] cursed chest addition: super strong wands, with a catch:
	[x] very high max mana, but 0 charge speed (so it cannot be used anymore at some point)

	[ ] always cast blood to acid
	[ ] always cast water to poison
	[ ] always cast liquid detonation

	[ ] always cast chaotic path (yo lmao)
	[x] always cast anti homing
	[ ] always cast acid (1 drop per cycle)
	[ ] always cast formation pentagon
	[ ] always cast formation behind your back (this could actually be a fun niche to explore)
	[ ] always cast add trigger/variants (after defeating mestarien mestari)
	[ ] always cast add trigger + some exotic projectile (after defeating mestarien mestari) <-- concentrated light/flock of ducks
	[x] always cast fizzle (slow and strong wand, so big shots have a chance to fail)
	[ ] always cast null shot
	[ ] always cast no explosion
	[x] always cast horizontal path (very rapid-fire wand)
	[x] a very sick sniper bolt wand
	[ ] always cast chaos larpa
	[ ] always cast orbit larpa (after defeating the dragon)
	[ ] a super strong rapidfire wand with always cast heavy spread (so you need ) but with high enough spread that you need 2 reduce spread spells to counter it (which has -60)

[ ] some kind of positive resource, like RPG Maker's TP? that can be used for special interactions

[ ] simplified missing mana to damage: +1 or +1% damage for every 100 or 10% missing mana

[!] expand mana buff: reduce cost by 90%

[ ] perk: gain 1 hp and max hp for every enemy killed. non-heart sources of healing become ineffective.

(basically "gain 50% dmg reduction for 20 seconds", a bit boring)

CROSS-MOD IDEAS

[ ] dead isn't dead / other respawn mods: apply a random curse upon death

[ ] community mod: special perks that are only available to classes? (maybe optional)


ENTIRELY NEW MODS?
[ ] Base Of Operations: a home for Mina is carved into the mountain's cliff.
	[ ] Home Portal: can be found in every Holy Mountain. wands and items can be tossed into it to add to storage. interact to enter it, maybe with a price. in your home, there will be a portal to take you back to the last HM you came from.
	[ ] Storage Chest: Ambitious interactable structure that holds all the spells you discard. Can be interacted with for an inventory-like interface where spells can be dragged out of.
	(+ wardrobe for wands?)
	[ ] Keepsake Chest: Even more ambitious version of the Storage Chest that has its contents (spells) persist over runs. Truly turns the game into a roguelite.
	(+ one for wands?)
	[ ] Portable Portal: item that functions like a Home Portal. requires channelling out of combat. leaves behind a portal.
	[ ] Ring of Life: teleports you home if you reach critical health. leaves behind a portal to warp back to.

[ ] Holy Mountain keys: randomly hidden somewhere in the biome above each HM, must be obtained before the player can progress.

[x] Beacon spell

[ ] Mod that allows you to swap your wand's sprite (via UI)

[ ] card packs (shop): replaces all nearby spells in the shop with spells from the corresponding mod (i.e. there would be an Apotheosis pack, a D2D pack, a Graham's pack...)
	[ ] compatibility for custom card packs, so if one mod's spell synergizes really well with another mod's spell, you can combine them with a high chance to spawn together
	[ ] spawn 3 'Card Pack' items before spells are spawned, which dictate the source of spells in the shop. the middle one is always 'random' (i.e. vanilla + all mods mashed together)
