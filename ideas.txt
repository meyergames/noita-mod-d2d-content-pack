IDEAS

[ ] Parry: short-range, medium-cooldown "explosion" that, when timed well, deflects bullets (like Revenge Bullets) with extra speed and damage.

[ ] Give the player "Peace With Gods" if they win a race while the gods were angry? (and the player was infected as a result)

[x] Borrowed Time: perk that splits half of all damage taken into damage-over-time (i.e. normally taking 44 damage from an explosion will now deal 22 damage instantaneously + 11 + 6 + 3 + 2 damage spread over 4 cycles of 1 second each)

[ ] Rework cursed chest into something like an "Unholy Contract"? With unique powerful perks (Master Of?) and spells (i.e. Curses To Damage) in trade for a perk. Could effectively still be a "chest" but with a different aesthetic.
- "Curses" need an icon for spells etc, and maybe for the lock on a cursed chest.

[ ] Divine prank: encase the player in a circle of brickwork(?) until their O2 is almost ran out

[ ] Pocket Dimension: Utility spell that stores all spells behind it as children of this spell. If it already contains spells, the spells are re-spawned for the player to pick up.

[ ] "Alt Fire Anything" base spell
Regular left-click: skip this spell and the (first) card it draws. If that seems technically impossible, reset the wand and trigger wand recharge time.
Right-click:		scan the wand for the first occurrence of this "Alt Fire" spell, and draw the first card behind it.

[x] modifier that has a chance to save a limited-use spell's uses is now possible!

[x] Fairy Reincarnation: enemies turn into small fairies upon death, lighting up the area

[-] One Wand Army: increase your damage dealt based on how few wands you are carrying <-- takes away the motivation to experiment

[ ] Maybe the "Rewind" spell is possible now, with my new understanding of the code?

[ ] Behind You! curse: a bomb floats behind you. when shot (by an enemy), it explodes for minor damage and knockback. recharges and reappears after 30 seconds

[ ] Divine prank: severely limit the player's FOV (like that one wizard) and play the sound of a really scary monster

[ ] Beacon: an item whose location is permanently shown on the player's UI, like on an Item Radar

[x] Reveal: a limited-use spell that temporarily reveals nearby wands and items

[ ] To "disable" a perk (e.g. for Master Of X), maybe we can get the perk's UIComponent and simply change its description and icon, and run the necessary scripts (i.e. the perk function "_remove" or smth)

[ ] Curse: like spontaneous combustion, but for a 5-second blindness effect "A mosquito flew into your eye!" (maybe with a permanent light added buzzing sound effect? like the firefly - maybe it could just spawn an entity that's like the Apotheosis swarm, but with less particles and only sporadically dealing 1 flavour damage) perk name: "Mosquitoes"

[-] do add Alt Fire Anything to this mod, as well?

[ ] Backtrack: "Teleports you to where you last touched the ground" (overwrite previous location when mFramesInAirCounter is exactly 1?)

[ ] Dismantle Wand: spell that destroys a nearby wand and spawns all the spells it contains.

[ ] ANVIL SPELLS: destroyed-on-use spells that alter your wand in one way or another.
	[ ] Hammer of Order | Makes a wand non-shuffle, sets its spells/cast to 1, and removes its always-cast spells
	[ ] Hammer of Chaos | Consume all spells to increase all stats, but the wand (has a chance to?) becomes shuffle
	[ ] Hammer of Capacity | Consume all spells to add +1 capacity for every 2 spells sacrificed (max 25)
	[ ] Hammer of Potential | Consume all spells to increase max mana by +25 for each spell sacrificed
	[ ] Hammer of Velocity | Consume all spells to increase fire rate by +10% for each spell sacrificed
	[ ] random spell spawns on the anvil in Hiisi Base, the rest is super rare
	[ ] when cast, the spell spawns the wand outside as a non-interactable

[ ] Simple perk that sets all wands' spells per cast to 1 ("No More Multicast")

[ ] Alcoholism curse: your aim is disturbed if you are NOT drunk. alcohol does not satiate you. (spawns a bottle of whiskey)

[ ] Unlock "Master Of X" by dealing Y damage of the same type during your run. if threshold passed, spawn perk on next enemy kill
	[ ] Try an electricity-oriented run (i.e. Electric Charge) and count the damage (via GamePrint obv)
	[ ] same for fire
	[ ] same for explosions

[ ] I should be able to make the Time Trial effect a timed status effect now, right?

[ ] Perk "Lost The Key": in the next biome, 1 (or more?) key is spawned somewhere that must be collected before the portals to the next Holy Mountain open. Some kind of reward upon entering the Holy Mountain.
	[ ] Might work better as a curse? "Lost My Keys!"

[ ] Minigun-esque passive spell that increases your wand's fire rate the longer the fire button is held. Could also gradually decrease a spell's mana cost by a bit, though maybe that'd be a bit unbalanced; it should have *some* kind of limit. (although maybe firing 60 magic arrows per second comes with its own set of downsides already)

[ ] Ness "PK Flash" spell that fires a slow, pulsating projectile ("bomb") if the player has none in the field already. While the player keeps the fire button down, the active wand's mana recharge is disabled; every second, 10% of the wand's max mana is consumed to fuel the bomb, sending homing particles from the wand to the bomb, its size and damage increasing based on mana consumed. Releasing the fire button, or when mana runs out after 10 seconds, causes the bomb to explode.
> max mana determines max charges (i.e. size/damage/effects)		example: 	1400 max mana = 1400 max charges
> mana charge speed determines charges per seconds					example: 	0 mana ch.sp  = +140 charges per second
  (minimum of +10% charge per second)								example:	10 mana ch.sp = +150 charges per second
																				255 m.ch.sp   = +395 charges per second
  (amount of particles sent from wand to bomb scales with charges added)
- 200+ charges: bomb starts attracting nearby liquids and powders like a black hole
- 400+ charges: bomb starts attracting nearby objects like barrels and lanterns
- 600+ charges: bomb starts attracting nearby enemies
- 800+ charges: bomb will release an earthquake upon exploding
- damage scaling should be somewhat exponential, to give a player a good reason to chase max mana > mana charge speed

[ ] A simple spell that grows bigger and more powerful the more mana the wand is missing, and the longer it takes for the wand to recharge its mana. A simplified missing mana to damage, basically. Maybe instead of increasing damage based on mana charge speed, the spell (and its low mana cost) naturally asks for a slow-charging wand in order to even reach the high damage boost.

[ ] essence to speed (increase fire rate if lots of enemies are nearby)

[x] spell that lasts ~5 frames and converts all nearby enemy projectiles (mWhoShot ~= player) into healing. high cast delay/recharge time.

[-] Inverse Energy Shield: looks in the opposite direction of the player's aim

[ ] Autonomous Energy Shield: rotates independently of aim direction, always looking at the nearest enemy that can be hit with a raycast

[x] Beacon (spell): creates a hovering beacon (similar to an aqua mine) that is always on the player's radar (until destroyed). It can be interacted with, using E, to change its color in the world and on the radar. Radar shape is unique to easily tell it apart from the radar perks.
	[-] While holding shift, show distance below radar marker? <-- faint/medium/strong does the job

[ ] Beacon teleport (spell): warp to the nearest placed beacon (that a raycast can't reach?). Very limited-use. Eligible beacon is highlighted on the radar.

[ ] Luminous Orb?

[ ] heart balloon, alt. time trial

[ ] cursed chest addition: super strong wands, with a catch:
	[x] very high max mana, but 0 charge speed (so it cannot be used anymore at some point)
	[ ] always cast nolla
	[x] always cast mana to damage
	[ ] always cast blood to acid
	[ ] always cast water to poison
	[ ] always cast liquid detonation

	[ ] always cast chaotic path (yo lmao)
	[x] always cast anti homing
	[ ] always cast acid (1 drop per cycle)
	[ ] always cast formation pentagon
	[ ] always cast formation behind your back (this could actually be a fun niche to explore)
	[ ] always cast add trigger/variants (after defeating mestarien mestari)
	[ ] always cast add trigger + some exotic projectile (after defeating mestarien mestari) <-- concentrated light/flock of ducks
	[x] always cast fizzle (slow and strong wand, so big shots have a chance to fail)
	[ ] always cast null shot
	[ ] always cast no explosion
	[x] always cast horizontal path (very rapid-fire wand)
	[x] a very sick sniper bolt wand
	[ ] always cast chaos larpa
	[ ] always cast orbit larpa (after defeating the dragon)
	[ ] a super strong rapidfire wand with always cast heavy spread (so you need ) but with high enough spread that you need 2 reduce spread spells to counter it (which has -60)

[ ] perk that restores HP on each enemy kill, equal to 1% of their max HP

[ ] passive spell that greatly empowers shuffle wands (for each unique spell in it?)

[ ] 'other' spell that halves the next spell's mana drain

[!] perk that gives enemies a chance to drop a spell card (scaling with max HP)

[ ] perk: the first spell in your inventory has its mana cost reduced to 0, but gains limited uses

[ ] perk: after not taking damage for at least 5 seconds, the first instance of damage is reduced by 90%

[ ] banshee's veil: after killing an enemy, gain an 8-second spell shield that destroys the first incoming projectile

[ ] perk: all holy mountains gain a portal that teleports you to one of the exit portals in the biome above (random)

[ ] greek spell: copy a random spell in your wand, 0 mana cost

[x] perk: temple hearts and spell refreshers are linked with a new item: hammer. upgrades your wand. picking up the heart or refresh makes the hammer disappear, picking up the hammer makes the heart and refresh disappear.
(use the Anvil of Destiny hammer sounds? if open source)

[ ] lizard tail: when you would die, gain a random curse but respawn at the last HM (using dead isn't dead code)

[ ] perk: limited-use spells cost 0 mana to use

[!] perk (one-off): all spells in your inventory are transformed into a random other spell of the same category; duplicate spells change into the same spells

[?] recycle buff: 75% chance not to use charge when it's the last one

[!] perk: obtain a curse. the other two perks will no longer cause the other to disappear.

[ ] some kind of positive resource, like RPG Maker's TP? that can be used for special interactions
	[ ] DnD-esque "Inspiration"? "Luck" that makes failed rng rolls still succeed? "Miracles"?

[ ] simplified missing mana to damage: +1 or +1% damage for every 100 or 10% missing mana

[x] expand mana buff: reduce cost by 90%

[ ] perk: gain 1 hp and max hp for every enemy killed. non-heart sources of healing become ineffective.

[ ] utility spell (limited-use): your (max) hp is doubled for 20 seconds, then halved again.
(basically "gain 50% dmg reduction for 20 seconds", a bit boring)

[ ] "Lock-On" (projectile): applies a debuff that makes the next projectile crit. high cast delay.

[ ] 'other': add all cards in your inventory to your hand

[ ] Thunder (spell): causes the entity with the most remaining HP on screen to take immense electric damage

[ ] 'other' spell (1 max use): if the next spell has 0 uses remaining, refill it

[ ] replenish mana (modifier): restore 25-50% of your wand's missing mana; adds cast delay like add mana.

[ ] projectile: deals 10 damage. high cast delay. if it kills an enemy, its damage is permanently increased by +1.
(limited-use?)

[ ] nasus Q: short-range drill attack that deals 12 damage; if it kills the enemy, the spell's damage is permanently increased by +1 to +3 (based on enemy max HP?). high cast delay.

[ ] curse: "Thorned Grip" take 1 damage when you switch between wands --> add a "script_enabled_changed" LuaComponent to all wands in hand and all wands picked up after getting this curse

[ ] modifier spell: "Combo" if the previous spell is a projectile different than the currently modified projectile --> Damage Plus but better

[ ] Viral Shot (modifier): applies a virus (LuaComponent) that deals 20 damage over 20 seconds. spreads to enemies; reapplied if an enemy dies from the virus.

[ ] ring of life: on death, drop all your wands, potions and spells (in a gravestone?(c)) and respawn with 100 or 25% of your max hp at the nearest HM exit above you. you must make it back to your death place with an empty inventory.

(https://discord.com/channels/453998283174576133/626947516369338388/1427814108429811783)

[ ] perk: transform starter wand into the "wand of humble beginnings" / bombings

[ ] nerf 'evolving wands' to only apply to the wand in your hand; make it stackable. maybe the first spell on your wand dictates which upgrade is applied to the wand? (also apply this to the hammer pickup?)

[ ] Pokeball-like spell that captures a creature if its health is low enough. Make it have a chance to escape

[ ] curse: passing a wand without firing it within 10 seconds has a chance to animate it, making it hostile towards you.

[ ] sticky modifier: causes a projectile to stick to whatever it collides with first

[-] teleport to cursor: high cast delay/recharge time.

		[-] the estimated destination could be displayed with an enabled_in_hand script? <-- eh

[x] modifier that causes a projectile to be destroyed if it's too far away from the player

[ ] modifier that causes a projectile to exist until you release fire / switch to a different wand

[ ] homing modifier that locks on to enemy projectiles?

[ ] modifier that halves the next spell's mana cost

[ ] buff Bolt Catcher with infinite casts?

[x] Time Trial rework
		[x] Rewards:
				[x] +15% mov speed
				[-] Blink (if <60s) or Blink With Trigger (if <30s)
						[ ] ...or a variant of the spell with much less cast delay / recharge time?
				[-] Chest (if <60s) or Greater Chest (if <30s)
		[x] Mechanics
				[-] Check if the player is in a PW; adjust X-position of chest (and area checks?) accordingly
				[-] For every 10 gold picked up, gain 10-30 extra gold once you arrive at the HM
				[x] Make the perk stackable

[x] Heart Balloon
		[x] For now, make it work without a balloon attached
		[x] Reduce health to 80%, bring to 200% afterwards ( x0.8 --> x2.5 ) <-- made it 75% -> 300% (225% total)

[ ] add Alt Fire Anything to D2D, IF the player doesn't have AFA already enabled

[ ] some kind of static field that greatly buffs (ignores homing?) 

[ ] really wanna make that polymorph clone shot work!! maybe learn about NXML and see if that can help me?

[ ] item that, when held while standing still for 8 seconds, teleports you to the last HM exit

[ ] curse that occasionally increases jump height dramatically

[ ] perk that shoots a lightning-like projectile, dealing slice-based damage and ignoring terrain, between your teleport start and end locations (nothing personnel, kid)

[ ] challenge perk where you must kill 100 enemies with a mana-locked wand
		[ ] reward: wand with legit infinite mana?

[ ] track kills made with Staff of Glass, print every 50th

[ ] glass shard projectile: only 1 initial slice damage, but each hit adds a stack to the enemy; not hitting them for 1 second consumes all stacks for 11 damage per stack. higher net dps than all other "rapidfire-compatible" projectile spells, but delayed damage and easy to overshoot. maybe upon triggering, shards are fired from the enemy in random directions, potentially hitting other enemies <-- friendly fire enabled for obvious reasons.

[ ] Warp Rush: also grant x2 damage on the next cast within 1 sec (i.e. empowers big shots)
		[ ] or make this a separate perk

[x] Precision: modifier that causes projectiles to disappear when they reach the position of the mouse where it was when the shot was fired (for e.g. precision teleporting)
		[x] could be an improved version of Quick Burner, where a small area around the mouse pos gains extra dmg
		[x] increase fire rate based on distance!!

[x] Shockwave: static projectile that knocks back everything around it

[x] Split Mana: "other" type spell that refunds 50% of the next spell's mana cost

[ ] 1/50 chance for certain mobs to drop its spell? i.e. the phantoms dropping their homing/duplicating spells

[ ] friend of the fairies reward: spell that causes all nearby fairies to be teleported to you

[ ] modifier that disables a projectile's sound effect (and maybe makes it completely invisible while we're at it)

[ ] Challenge Perk that "steals" the wands and items in your inventory + lowers your Wand Tinkering level by 1, challenging you to make it to the next Holy Mountain with just the wands and items you find along the way.
		- maybe: set max health to 10% or 100, whichever is higher? <--- meh, should be challenging enough as-is
		- rewards? good question. could scale with the amount of kills you make

[ ] telekinetic sip: utility spell that causes you to take a sip of the last potion in your inventory

[ ] telekinetic bath: utility spell that causes you to be stained with some of the last potion in your inventory

[ ] Backtrack perk: teleports you to the previous HM. other perks won't disappear when taking this one.

[ ] perk that causes Polymorph to transform you into something stronger / more defensively capable than a sheep (mecha-sheep that can destroy projectiles and has *some* more than 1 HP??)

[ ] spell that causes nearby fairies to be teleported to you

[x] spell that causes nearby charmed creatures to be teleported to you <-- new icon

[ ] perk that gives you a circle of-sized aura that starts out inactive. it becomes active when a charmed creature enters, providing a shield and mana regeneration buff
		[ ] alternatively: charmed creatures gain a shield and an aura that grants you extra mana regen

[ ] arrow of love: limited-use, pheromone-coloured magic arrow (with heart particles) that charms whatever it hits. may only work on organic creatures, like with giga drain?
		- option A: deals hefty damage on impact; only works on creatures that would survive the shot (ambrosia ftw?)
		- option B: deals 2% of an enemy's max health per second, meaning the creature is on a 50-second death sentence

[ ] friend of the fairies upgrades (extra perks?):
		[ ] 100 fairies freed: touching a fairy will heal you for 1% of your max health, then teleport them away.
		[ ] 250 fairies freed: fairies will try to intercept enemy projectiles heading in your direction.
		[ ] 500 fairies freed: when you fall below 20% health, charmed big fairies come to the rescue.
		[ ] 1000 fairies freed: the Fairy In A Jar item can be found in the Fairy Nest biome. when you die, the jar breaks to revive and teleport you to the Fairy Nest.

[ ] big-scope idea: a tiny fairy biome at the bottom left or right corner of the coal mines. entering it without having killed any fairies spawns (and unlocks?) the Friend of the Fairies perk. (then it'd be removed from the HM pool)

[ ] feline affection update: track which unique cat varieties the player has petted; print the progress. petting all unique cat entities will unlock something cool (cat ear cosmetic for Mina?)

[x] perk rebalance - all seeing eye: only reveals a small area around the cursor (like Magic Light)
		[x] GamePrint on pickup: "Prefer the old All Seeing Eye? You can disable D2D Content Pack's rebalance changes in the mod settings."

[ ] simple modifier that adds damage based on the projectile's speed

[ ] perk that pheromones anything you stay very close to for 8 seconds

[ ] hmmm.... what happens if you fill a HM portal's teleportatium pool with some other liquid? :think

[ ] cross-run (roguelite) base in HM!!

[x] staff of ancients: staff that always remembers its spells across runs. if it's thrown out of the inventory OR the player dies while it's in the inventory, it stores all spells in a string

[x] perk that gives enemies a chance to drop small "Gems" (despawns after a few seconds, like gold)
		when picked up, limited-use spells regain 10% (rounded down) of their uses
		+ [(max_uses % 10) * 10]% chance to regain 1 use

[ ] strong projectile that can only exist in liquids (i.e. is destroyed when it touches air)

[ ] a new boss where ALL mana regeneration is disabled. the challenge will be to balance power with mana consumption.

[ ] show an update print when the player walks near (or takes) "All-Seeing Eye" or "Unlimited Spells"

[ ] some kind of unique staff to unlock from Cursed Chests; maybe the Remembrance ghost can be locked behind it?
		(but first let's see how the Staff of Remembrance lands as-is)

[ ] unlock "Infatuating Arrow" / "Command: Attack" / "Ally Protection" by pheromoning Friend?

[ ] "Does anyone know if there's any hax way to get game settings, like brightness, or more specifically "Allow firing of wands 		 while inventory is open"? I can't see anything in the lua API to scan for it"
		- "just check inv gui?"

[ ] perk that causes larpa etc to copy modifiers as well?

[ ] carpet bomb-esque spell that, upon hitting an enemy, shoots a volley of projectiles in a cone behind it
		[ ] Larpa Carpet

[ ] giga drain changes
		[ ] new vfx/sfx on no enemy hit (replacing chainsaw effect)
		[ ] halve recoil
		[ ] ragdoll_fx NORMAL when it hits
		[ ] improve consistency with triggering damage and bubbles

[>] bolt catcher
		[x] return same projectile to enemy
		[ ] increase heal OR remove limited uses to balance enemies more easily dying to their own projectiles

[ ] scatter shot: modifier that causes a projectile to deal 0-50%(?) damage, but immediately shoot a copy at every nearby enemy 									(with the player as mWhoShot). the initial shot should have its explosion removed (e.g. magic missile).
									^ how does Delayed Cast handle casting a full hand, rather than just the naked projectile?

[ ] test glass shard and infatuating arrow larpa interactions

[ ] greek letter nerf attempt
		[~] idea #1: disable casting at 0 uses, but make spells only lose a charge every 10 uses (e.g. black hole: 3 --> 30 uses)
								 require defeating a late-game boss (harder than Ylialkemisti) to gain a perk that re-enables Greek letters to cast spells with 0 uses. <-- added in the form of Recycle+
		[-] idea #2: remove Greek letter drops from Ylialkemisti. instead make it drop a new spell:
								 [ ] other-type spell with 100 uses. if the next spell has limited uses, this spell loses its own uses to spare the affected spell's. consume more uses when used for spells with less uses:
								 -1 for spells with 20+ charges
								 -2 for spells with 10+ charges
								 -3 for spells with 5+ charges
								 -4 for spells with 3+ charges
								 -5 for spells with 1+ charges
								 		^ too convoluted; Second Wind will do the trick (for now)

[ ] portal in each Holy Mountain that allows you to teleport to the previous one, for a cost that scales with the HM tier
		[ ] could be placed above the perk altar
		[ ] one-off perk that spawns a singular portal to the previous HM?

[ ] option to disable the mana too low sfx while rapidfiring?

[ ] shedinja-like enemy that has 1 hp and resistances against everything except one random damage_type weakness

[ ] glass shard splinters not shooting when the damage kills an enemy might be due to the corpse blocking the projectiles

[ ] sticky modifier to attach bombs to ceilings (or does Glue Charge achieve this?)




CROSS-MOD IDEAS

[ ] dead isn't dead / other respawn mods: apply a random curse upon death

[ ] community mod: special perks that are only available to classes? (maybe optional)





ENTIRELY NEW MODS?
[ ] Base Of Operations: a home for Mina is carved into the mountain's cliff.
	[ ] Home Portal: can be found in every Holy Mountain. wands and items can be tossed into it to add to storage. interact to enter it, maybe with a price. in your home, there will be a portal to take you back to the last HM you came from.
	[ ] Storage Chest: Ambitious interactable structure that holds all the spells you discard. Can be interacted with for an inventory-like interface where spells can be dragged out of.
	(+ wardrobe for wands?)
	[ ] Keepsake Chest: Even more ambitious version of the Storage Chest that has its contents (spells) persist over runs. Truly turns the game into a roguelite.
	(+ one for wands?)
	[ ] Portable Portal: item that functions like a Home Portal. requires channelling out of combat. leaves behind a portal.
	[ ] Ring of Life: teleports you home if you reach critical health. leaves behind a portal to warp back to.

[ ] Holy Mountain keys: randomly hidden somewhere in the biome above each HM, must be obtained before the player can progress.

[x] Beacon spell

[ ] Mod that allows you to swap your wand's sprite (via UI)

[ ] card packs (shop): replaces all nearby spells in the shop with spells from the corresponding mod (i.e. there would be an Apotheosis pack, a D2D pack, a Graham's pack...)
	[ ] compatibility for custom card packs, so if one mod's spell synergizes really well with another mod's spell, you can combine them with a high chance to spawn together
	[ ] spawn 3 'Card Pack' items before spells are spawned, which dictate the source of spells in the shop. the middle one is always 'random' (i.e. vanilla + all mods mashed together)

[ ] TP as a resource: a resource unique to Minä. Used as fuel for limited-use spells, replacing uses.
		Enemies may drop a bubble that restores 1 TP / Spell Refresh restores all.
		100 max TP at run start
		+10 TP for each Spell Refresh picked up
		Example spell costs:
		- Healing bolt:				 -5	TP (20 casts)
		- Black hole:					-30 TP (4 casts after 2nd HM)
		- Dark Flame:					 -2 TP (50 casts; +5 per spell refresh)
		- Circle of Vigour:		-75 TP (2 casts after 2nd HM)
