[h1]SPELL HIGHLIGHTS[/h1]


[h3]Sniper Bolt (With Trigger)[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Kbsfg71.gif[/img]
Pretty much the same as Snipuhiisi’s projectile.
Penetrates all enemies it encounters in a straight line.
Super satisfying to use.

Its low fire rate makes accuracy very important; not ideal against small/fast enemies.



[h3]Giga Drain[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/69qcaWJ.gif[/img]
Causes organic creatures to spawn healing bubbles that last a few seconds.
If it kills a creature, pink bubbles are spawned that increase max health.

By default, the spell is slow and expensive to use, and can only be used at melee range.
Using it on a trigger is advised, but you do need to pick up the bubbles fast.



[h3]Super Banana Bomb[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Fa8WGtT.gif[/img]
Especially strong against worms.
(not really)



[h3]Unstable Nucleus[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/5FmAUn8.gif[/img]
Stays alive as long as you hold the fire button.
Mana fuels it to become more and more powerful.



[h3]Overclock[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/sMW6S0N.gif[/img]
Modifier that pushes your wand's fire rate to its limits, but gives it a chance to overheat.

Overheat chance is higher when mana is low.
As such, it is advised to fire an overclocked wand in short bursts.



[h3]Fixed Altitude[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/gmhcAji.gif[/img]
Passive spell that resets your vertical velocity while firing.
A rapidfire wand will effectively make you hover in the air.

[h1]ITEM HIGHLIGHTS[/h1]

[h3]Emergency Injection[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/hUpZRlP.png[/img]
A dubious mixture of healthium and some pitch-black liquid.
Instantly restores [i]all[/i] health. At a cost, of course...



[h3]Cursed Chest[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/DUdt23J.png[/img]
Open it for a blessing and a [i]Curse[/i].
Curses are perks with (mostly) subtle negative side effects.
An example can be found a bit further down.

Potential loot includes (normal) perks and a few unique spells.

[h1]PERK HIGHLIGHTS[/h1]

[h3]Time Trial[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/pGxyYp0.gif[/img]
The gods challenge you to a race.
Reach the next Holy Mountain within 60 seconds to be greatly rewarded.
Obtain a random Curse if you lose.



[h3]Repel Gold (curse)[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/uPLX2ND.gif[/img]
One example of a Curse.
Does what it says on the tin.



[h3]Evolving Wands[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/T9KWfEx.png[/img]
Your wands gain a random upgrade each time you enter a new biome.
Each 5th upgrade is a bigger, all-round upgrade.

Rewards holding on to your (starter) wands.



[h3]Master Of Bombs[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/yJR8pEY.gif[/img]
Your explosions are bigger and can destroy stronger materials.
Non-explosive projectiles become explosive, as well.

Only works if you are NOT immune to explosions.



[h3]Master Of Lightning[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/wumG5Hi.gif[/img]
Permanently increases your fire rate.
Gives all your projectiles an electric charge.
After being electrocuted, gain an even stronger buff.

Only works if you are NOT immune to electricity.



[h3]Borrowed Time[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/mIEU62s.gif[/img]
You survive fatal damage, at the cost of your max health.

[h1]CROSS-MOD COMPATIBILITY[/h1]

✅ [b]Apotheosis[/b]
Compatible! Additionally, this mod has some content that requires Apotheosis to work. If you want to enable that content, be sure to place Apotheosis above this mod in your mod list.

If Apotheosis is not enabled, the aforementioned content will simply be disabled.


❓️ [b]Entangled Worlds[/b]
So far, spells appear to work, but the effects of the "Master Of" perks seem to be invisible to other players.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]

[h1]FINAL NOTES[/h1]

This mod will probably be updated every now and then, with balance tweaks and more new content.

I've tried making everything feel as natural within the world of Noita as possible, and as balanced as I could with only my own two eyes. If you notice something is too strong, too weak, too common, too rare etc, please let me know!

Also feel free to think along and share your suggestions with me. For example, I'd like the "Master Of" perks to feel a bit more special than just another perk you can find in every Holy Mountain, so maybe you know of a cool way to unlock them?
